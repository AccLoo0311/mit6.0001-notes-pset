UNDERSTANDING PROGRAM EFFICIENCY,理解程序效率
1.HOW TO EVALUATE EFFICIENCY OF PROGRAMS:
    (1)measure with a timer:
        import time
    (2)COUNTING OPERATIONS
    (3)ORDERS OF GROWTH (增长级)
        not worry about small variations in implementation
        look at largest factors in run time
        ignore addictive constants
        ignore multiplicative constants

eg:O(n) vs 5n+2 steps
def fact_iter(n):
    answer = 1
    while n > 1:
        answer=answer*n
        n=n-1
    return answer
    (4)LINEAR COMPLEXITY：
        Simple iteractive loop algorithms
    (5)QUADRATIC COMPLEXITY:
        nested loop
eg:
def intersect(L1, L2):
    tmp = []
    for e1 in L1:
        for e2 in L2:
            if e1 == e2:
                tmp.append(e1)  #O(n^2)
    res = []
    for e in tmp:
        if not(e in res):
            res.append(e)  #O(n^2)
    return res
